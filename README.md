# Crop Yield Prediction Project ðŸŒ¾

This project predicts rice yields using a neural network model based on agricultural and environmental factors. It includes advanced preprocessing, feature engineering, and robust evaluation methods and uses PyTorch for the ease of use.

## Features of the Project

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, scales features, and selects the most relevant ones for predictions.
- **Feature Engineering**: Introduces metrics like total crop area, rice area ratio, production efficiency, and moving averages.
- **Model Architecture**: A multi-layer neural network with advanced layers like dropout and batch normalization.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates predictions using RMSE, RÂ², and MAPE.
- **Visualizations**: Provides a graph through scatter plots and training history graphs.

## Data Source

The dataset is sourced from [nileshely](https://github.com/nileshely/Crop-Datasets-for-All-Indian-States). The primary file used is `.Crops_data.csv`.

## What's Included

- Feature engineering and selection for better predictions.
- Neural network training and evaluation with robust loss functions using PyTorch for simplicity.
- Visualizations of model performance and results in a graph for better understanding.
